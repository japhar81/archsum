Using our OpenShift cluster, follow these tutorials (in order);
1. [https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/resource-objects/][1]
2. [https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/deploying-python/][2]
3. [https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/port-forwarding/][3]

Once you are comfortable with these concepts, put it all together, and deploy a full Java application, with a backend DB. This tutorial provides a good reference on how to do so; [http://www.mastertheboss.com/soa-cloud/openshift/java-ee-example-application-on-openshift][4]
